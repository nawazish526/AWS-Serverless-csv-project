# AWS-Serverless-csv-project
AWS Serverless CSV Processing Pipeline
A serverless data processing project built using AWS S3, AWS Lambda, and IAM. This pipeline automatically triggers a Lambda function whenever a CSV file is uploaded to an S3 bucket, processes the data, and stores the transformed output back into S3. The project demonstrates event-driven architecture, IAM role-based access control, and real-time data processing using AWS Serverless Services.
